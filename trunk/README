INSTALL:

Needed: Ruby (I used 1.8.4), and the following gems: actionmailer, actionpack, actionwebservice, activerecord, activesupport, memcache-client
        mysql, rails, rake, sources, fcgi, optional: rmagick, captcha, progressbar

Check what you have with "gem list", if you don't have something "gem install <package>"
Copy the source to a suitable place in your file system, mine is in /var/www/localhost/rtcrackonline


1. To setup Apache:

(I'm using Apache 2.0.58)

If you plan to use Apache set up a virtualhost similar to this one, of course replacing the directory structure with your's.

<VirtualHost *:80>
    SetEnv RAILS_ENV development
    ServerAdmin you@shmoo.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/localhost/rtcrackonline/public/
    ServerName rtcrackonline
    ServerAlias rtcrackonline
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/rtcrackonline-error_log
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/rtcrackonline-access_log common
    <Directory /var/www/localhost/rtcrackonline/public/>
      Allow from all
      AllowOverride all
      Order allow,deny
    </Directory>
    Options Indexes ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    RewriteEngine On
</VirtualHost>


If you want to just test it quickly without setting up Apache, once you reach the end of this README run "script/server" from the rails directory.

* Check to see which version of Rails you have, then edit RAILS_GEM_VERSION in config/environment.rb 

* Complile an rcrack for your OS, I left the source in app/cracker/rainbowcrack-freebsd/ and rainbowcrack-linux/, make sure you use the source I 
included becuase I modified it

* Copy over the compiled rcrack binary and the tables you wish to use to app/cracker/rcrack/
(This version of rtcrackonline has only been tested with the alpha and alpha-numeric tables)

* Create a database called webrt_development
* Change the mysql login information in config/databases.yml
* Run "rake migrate" from the rails directory

* Edit additional config options in config/environment.rb

A few of the following steps to get this thing running I would like to make automated in later versions.... 

* Run script/server
* Run ruby app/cracker/driver.rb
(if you want the dns feature) Run ruby app/dns/dns_server.rb

* Access the interface at <ip>:3000/webrt if you're using Webrick
